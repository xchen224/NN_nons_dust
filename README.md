# NN_nons_dust

This respository includes the data and python code used in the paper "Prediction and linearization of scattering properties of non-spherical dust particle properties with machine learning".

1. The directory "Tmat_Jac" includes the Jacobians data we prepared from linearized T-matrix model.
2. The directory "NN_model" includes the NN models we trained and the python code we used to read NN model, make predictions and compare with T-matrix data.
