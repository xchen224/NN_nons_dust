# NN_nons_dust

This respository includes the python code used in the paper "Prediction and linearization of scattering properties of non-spherical dust particle properties with machine learning" to make predictions and compare with T-matrix data from pre-trained NN model. The pre-trained NN model parameters, the training dataset and the Jacobians data derived from linearized T-matrix model are saved at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5768633
